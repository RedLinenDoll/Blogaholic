Hi Andrew and Yu-Cheng,
We only have internal access in our Google organization at this moment, 
and we registered our organization as aucklanduni.ac.nz.
We do not have your aucklanduni emails (the auckland.ac.nz emails are rejected),
So if you would like to test our google log-in, please contact Akash [mailto: apra984@aucklanduni.ac.nz], and he will add it for you.
(Or, our native Blogaholic account creation is quite good to use too)
Thank you!
